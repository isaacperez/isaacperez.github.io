I am an experienced and highly motivated artificial intelligence expert with a keen interest in deep learning.

My professional and academic journey has been dedicated to mastering deep learning and computer vision. I have developed and deployed innovative image processing and deep learning systems from scratch in various startups and large companies.

I have been involved in several technology transfer projects, publications, and patents, applying deep learning models and designing computer vision algorithms across diverse fields such as medicine, agriculture, biodiversity, and industry. My expertise spans all stages of implementing deep learning systems, from data collection and preparation to deploying and maintaining solutions, including installation, configuration, and maintenance of GPU servers. I have achieved significant improvements in model performance, reductions in training times, and increases in accuracy through optimized multi-GPU cloud environments.

The revolution will be derivable or it will not be.
